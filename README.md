**Reflection / Discussion Prompts**

If this were a real food delivery platform, how would you use these insights (top cuisines, top spenders, busiest city)?

What data quality issues would you expect at larger scale (duplicates, missing, outliers)?

Which problems would require streaming/near-real-time processing instead of batch?
